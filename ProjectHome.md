# Introduction #
This project includes public codes from Jump Wisely, so many sub-projects may be included and there is no single topic these codes are on. I will try to leave complete document so that you guys can refer or comment on any of them you are interested in!

# Notice #
**If you want these code for your course project:** Please **DON'T** copy-and-paste into your assignment; this is no good to yourself. And also, these source codes are copy-right protected by GNU GPL so you have to state that you copy the code here. I believe that any of your professor will be glad if you can have your own contribution, so feel free to modify the code, and state your contribution required by GNU GPL, if you really want to refer to these code line-by-line!
